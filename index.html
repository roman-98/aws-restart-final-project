              <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
              <p>
                  As a system administrator with over four years of experience in technical support and system administration, I specialise in setting up, maintaining, and optimising networks and operating systems. I am now transitioning into a cloud-focused role as a DevOps Engineer. My journey in IT began at Bader Ukraine, where I developed a passion for technology and problem-solving through hands-on work and self-directed learning. Later, I worked as a monitoring and network engineer at an ISP, where I enhanced my understanding of infrastructure and networks, while also improving my communication skills with clients. Recently, I completed the AWS re/Start bootcamp by Generation Ireland, gaining practical experience with AWS services. I am eager to apply my skills and continue growing in a dynamic DevOps environment.

            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>
              First of all, I have always been interested in cloud technologies and development in general, and I have enjoyed solving various technical problems, related to network configuration, software installation and operating system upgrades, since I started working as a system administrator. I started to take an active interest in IT technologies when I got my first job as a system administrator. I searched for information wherever possible, but at that time, YouTube was the most effective for me, where I found and saved videos on technical topics, read articles on technical topics, such as how to install specific software on a computer, how to create bootable USB sticks, articles on computer networks, articles on Linux and worked a lot with the hardware and software of computers. I became interested in programming and development tools, first tried to write in Python, used pycharm, also got acquainted with postgres, created the first tables, later came up with the idea to create a telegram bot that performed the function of searching for books in the library. Later, I discovered docker and understood what containerisation was. That's how I discovered DevOps and realised that I was ready to work and develop in this field.
            </p>
            <p>
              While working as a system administrator at Bader Ukraine, my desire to develop in the IT industry, and especially in cloud technologies, has become even stronger. There, I worked a lot with infrastructure and networks, performed Help Desk tasks and communicated with people a lot, which made my job even more interesting and I realized that the production depends on my IT team, so I tried to do my best. It was there that I got acquainted with Go and later became interested in web development. Working as a monitoring engineer and later as a network engineer at an ISP, I delved even deeper into networks and infrastructure, studied protocols, IP addressing and routing, I was most interested in infrastructure, also did tasks related to CCTV and maintained intercoms in a residential complex, in particular, helped build a computer network in one of these residential complexes. As a support engineer, I had to communicate a lot with legal clients, which gave me a lot of experience in solving problems in infrastructure and networks. There I worked with the Zabbix monitoring system. That's how I became interested in cloud technologies, and later decided to apply for the AWS re/start programme from Generation, where, in addition to learning AWS services, I developed behavioural and communication skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a DevOps Engineer, I would like to develop my communication skills and develop my programming. Although I have worked a lot as a system administrator, this will not prevent me from diving into software development, especially since it is a great motivation for me. With the development of my career, I paid special attention to Linux, also containerisation and orchestration, Docker and Kubernetes. Developing skills in working with CI/CD pipelines, including Jenkins, GitHub Actions and ArgoCD. An integral part of my technical skills is working with infrastructure as code, namely Terraform. I am looking to find a team where I can demonstrate my knowledge and skills and start a professional career in software development. Besides coming to work to do my job, I want to learn as much as I can to become an experienced DevOps Engineer.
